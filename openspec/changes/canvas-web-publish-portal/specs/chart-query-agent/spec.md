## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Chart Query Agent runtime backed by snapshot data
A new `ChartQueryAgent` backend class SHALL wrap `ClaudeSDKClient` the same way as `AgentRuntime`, but with a restricted MCP tool set operating on snapshot data only. The agent MUST NOT have access to any live DuckDB session or to tables outside the published page's snapshot.

#### Scenario: Agent initialized per page
- **WHEN** a chat message is sent to `POST /portal/pages/{page_id}/chat`
- **THEN** the backend resolves the snapshot for `page_id`, loads (or retrieves from cache) its in-memory DuckDB, and routes the message through `ChartQueryAgent`

#### Scenario: Agent tools limited to snapshot
- **WHEN** the `ChartQueryAgent` executes a tool call
- **THEN** only `list_snapshot_tables`, `describe_snapshot_table`, and `query_snapshot_table` are available; any attempt to call a non-snapshot tool is rejected by the guardrail

#### Scenario: Live session isolation
- **WHEN** `ChartQueryAgent` runs
- **THEN** it has no reference to any `AgentRuntime` instance, live DuckDB session, or upload-tier dataset

### Requirement: Snapshot DuckDB loaded lazily and cached with TTL
The backend SHALL maintain an LRU cache of in-memory DuckDB instances keyed by `page_id`. Each instance is loaded on first chat request and evicted after a configurable TTL (default: 30 minutes) or when the cache reaches its max size (default: 10 entries).

#### Scenario: Cache hit
- **WHEN** a second chat message arrives for the same `page_id` within the TTL
- **THEN** the snapshot DuckDB is retrieved from cache without re-reading snapshot files

#### Scenario: Cache eviction on TTL
- **WHEN** the TTL expires for a cached snapshot DuckDB
- **THEN** the entry is evicted; the next request for that `page_id` reloads from snapshot files

#### Scenario: Cache eviction on capacity
- **WHEN** the cache is at max size and a new `page_id` is requested
- **THEN** the least-recently-used entry is evicted to make room

### Requirement: Chart context scopes the agent conversation
When a chat message is sent with a `chart_id` field, the system SHALL prepend a system prompt prefix informing the agent which snapshot table is active and what the chart represents, based on the chart's `spec.json` and `data.json`.

#### Scenario: Chart selected before asking
- **WHEN** the user selects a chart on the published page and sends a message
- **THEN** the request body includes `{ "chart_id": "<id>", "message": "..." }` and the agent's system prompt includes the chart's table name, column descriptions, and chart type

#### Scenario: No chart selected
- **WHEN** the user sends a message without selecting a chart
- **THEN** the agent operates with visibility of all snapshot tables and selects the most relevant one based on the question

#### Scenario: Chart context reset on deselection
- **WHEN** the user deselects the active chart (clicks elsewhere)
- **THEN** subsequent messages are sent without `chart_id`

### Requirement: Agent responses streamed as SSE to the portal chat window
The portal chat endpoint `POST /portal/pages/{page_id}/chat` SHALL stream events using the same SSE event types as the existing query runtime: `planning`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `final`, `error`.

#### Scenario: Streaming response received
- **WHEN** the `ChartQueryAgent` processes a turn
- **THEN** the portal chat window displays events progressively as they arrive: tool use indicators while querying, then the final answer

#### Scenario: Error event on agent failure
- **WHEN** the `ChartQueryAgent` encounters an unrecoverable error
- **THEN** an `error` SSE event is emitted and the chat window displays a user-facing error message

### Requirement: Agent guardrails apply to snapshot queries
The `ChartQueryAgent` SHALL apply the same SQL-read-only validation (`SQLReadOnlyValidator`) to any SQL executed against the snapshot DuckDB. Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, CREATE) MUST be rejected.

#### Scenario: Read-only SQL accepted
- **WHEN** the agent issues a SELECT query against a snapshot table
- **THEN** the query executes and results are returned

#### Scenario: Write SQL rejected
- **WHEN** the agent attempts a mutating SQL statement
- **THEN** `SQLReadOnlyValidator` raises a validation error, the query is not executed, and an `error` event is emitted
